# Catbox

A set of themes inspired by [Catpuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) and [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). 

## Why?

I love the coloring style of Catppuccin but i never enjoyed the lack of truly comfy lightmode, with the provided one feeling very sterile and eye searing to me. So i set out to make more themes that can be retrofitted into Catppuccin's existing extensions and ports with little more than a few find and replace operations!

This simplifies the swap for any prospective users, and means the theme already has a MASSIVE wealth of knowledge on how to effectively use it compared to if i made a whole new theme. My only hope here is people enjoy the theme :3
