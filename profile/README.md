# Catbox

Solving Catpuccin's failures since 2024.

## What?

Let's be honest, Catppuccin Latte takes ["harmoniously inverting the essence of Catppuccin's dark themes"](https://catppuccin.com/palette) way too far and away from ["Soothing pastel theme"](https://catppuccin.com/) and into "Searing eye-obliterating theme".

To solve this, i made set of themes inspired by [Catpuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) and [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). It offers pastel lightmodes akin to gruvbox while being brighter than gruvbox

## Why?

I love the coloring style of Catppuccin but i never enjoyed the lack of truly comfy/soothing lightmode, with the provided one feeling very sterile and eye searing. So i set out to make more themes that can be retrofitted into Catppuccin's existing extensions (that don't use custom colors) and ports with little more than a few find and replace operations!

This simplifies the swap for any prospective users, and means the theme already has a MASSIVE wealth of knowledge on how to effectively use it compared to if i made a whole new theme. My only hope here is people enjoy the theme :3

## What themes are there?

For starters, they are named after teas, since i like tea more than coffee
